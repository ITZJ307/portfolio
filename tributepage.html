    <section id="tribute-info">
      <p>Travis Scott is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Born Jacques Webster, he gained limelight in 2012, when he signed his first major label deal with Epic Records. The same year he signed a deal with Kanye West’s GOOD Music’s VERY GOOD Beats. To mark his association, he was seen in the label’s 2012 compilation ‘Cruel Summer’. In April 2013, Scott signed a record deal with T.I.'s Grand Hustle imprint as well. The same year, he made his big debut on the music scene with his first full-length mixtape ‘Owl Pharaoh’. Scott’s journey as a rapper and singer zoomed further as he followed it with a second mixtape ‘Days Before Rodeo’, in August 2014. However, it was the single ‘Antidote’ from his album ‘Rodeo’ that catapulted his career to a glorious future. The single not just became a big hit but was his first to reach the top 20 of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Scott’s career has been soaring high since then and his second album ‘Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight’ and a collaborative album ‘Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho’ have fared extremely well.</p>
